# Breast Cancer Prediction Classifier Algorithms

This project aims to analyze and predict breast cancer using several classifier algorithms. The notebook provides a detailed analysis and comparison of different machine learning models on the breast cancer dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the breast cancer dataset, which can be found in the file `breast-cancer-data.csv`. It includes various features related to breast cancer tumors and their classifications.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are used in this project:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scipy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps include:
- Loading the dataset
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Standardizing the features

## Classification Algorithms

The following machine learning algorithms are used for classification:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost Classifier

## Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated based on the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- ROC Curve
- AUC Score

## Results and Conclusion

The notebook provides detailed results for each model, including performance metrics and visualizations. The best-performing model is identified based on the evaluation metrics.
